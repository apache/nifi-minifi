Apache MiNiFi Command And Control Server
-------------
A subproject of Apache NiFi and a complementary data collection approach that supplements the core tenets of NiFi in dataflow management, focusing on the collection of data at the source of its creation.

Specific goals for the initial thrust of the MiNiFi effort comprise:

* small and lightweight footprint,
* central management of agents,
* generation of data provenance, and
* integration with NiFi for follow-on dataflow management and full chain of custody of information.

Perspectives of the role of MiNiFi should be from the perspective of the agent acting immediately at, or directly adjacent to, source sensors, systems, or servers.
