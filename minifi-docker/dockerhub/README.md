# Docker Image Quickstart

  
## Building
The Docker image can be built using the following command:

    docker build -t apache/nifi-minifi:latest .

This build will result in an image tagged apache/nifi:latest

    # user @ puter in ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi/minifi-docker/dockerhub
    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY               TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED                 SIZE
    apache/nifi-minifi              latest              f0f564eed149        A long, long time ago   226MB

**Note**: The default version of NiFi specified by the Dockerfile is typically that of one that is unreleased if working from source.
To build an image for a prior released version, one can override the `NIFI_VERSION` build-arg with the following command:
    
    docker build --build-arg=MINIFI_VERSION={Desired MiNiFi Version} -t apache/nifi-minifi:latest .

## Running a container

### Supplying configuration to a container
The primary means by which a MiNiFi instance is configured is via the `config.yml` or the `bootstrap.conf`.

This can be accomplished through:
 * the use of volumes, and
  * overlaying the base image

#### Using volumes to provide configuration
The following example shows the usage of two volumes to provide both a `config.yml` and a `bootstrap.conf` to the container instance.  This makes use of configuration files on the host and maps them to be used by the MiNiFi instance.  This is helpful in scenarios where a single image is used for a variety of configurations.

    docker run -d \
        -v ~/minifi-conf/config.yml:/opt/minifi/minifi-0.5.0/conf/config.yml \
        -v ~/minifi-conf/bootstrap.conf:/opt/minifi/minifi-0.5.0/conf/bootstrap.conf \
        apache/nifi-minifi:0.5.0
        
#### Using volumes to provide configuration
Alternatively, it is possible to create a custom image inheriting from the published image.  Creating a `Dockerfile` extending from the Apache NiFi MiNiFi base image allows users to overlay the configuration permanently into a newly built and custom image.  A simple example follows:

    FROM apache/nifi-minifi
    
    ADD config.yml /opt/minifi/minifi-0.5.0/conf/config.yml
    ADD bootstrap.conf /opt/minifi/minifi-0.5.0/conf/bootstrap.conf
    
Building this `Dockerfile` will result in a custom image with the specified configuration files incorporated into the new image.  This is best for applications where configuration is well defined and relatively static.
